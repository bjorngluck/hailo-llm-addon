## 2.0.0
- **Major feature release**: Persistent model storage on HAOS (/data) — models now survive service restarts and HAOS reboots.
- New built-in modern interactive chat UI (OpenWebUI-inspired) served directly at the ingress:
  - Model selector + dedicated Models manager.
  - Curated one-click downloads for Hailo-optimized models + free-text model pull with live progress.
  - Full chat experience: conversation history (server-persisted), streaming responses, regenerate, copy, edit, stop.
  - Sidebar with chat management (new/rename/delete), modern dark design, keyboard friendly.
- Architecture change: hailo-ollama runs internally; Python layer (Flask) provides the UI + thin transparent proxy so the Ollama-compatible API surface remains available on the same port.
- `auto_download_model` option is now honored (triggers pull of a default recommended model on first start).
- Improved run.sh with readiness checks, better logging, and proper background process management.
